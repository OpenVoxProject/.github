## Welcome to the OpenVox community 👋

Like the mythical bird, OpenVox has risen from the ashes of what used to be Open Source Puppet. We are still in the process of forming and architecting our governance, so follow this space!

OpenVox is fully Puppet™️ compatible, so modules from the Forge will work, examples and guidelines
from books will all work, etc. All the OSP / Puppetserver / PuppetDB / etc docs from puppet.com/docs
apply. When we inevitably end up diverging, we will document that and create our own docs space.


### 🎪 An interconnected community

You can get involved in the OpenVox community by connecting at events, getting or giving help in any of our many channels, sharing modules on the Forge, contributing code, docs, or any of your valuable insights--and many other ways, too! However you decide to jump in, we know you’ll learn a lot and enjoy meeting the smart, friendly people who make up the OpenVox community.

Maybe you'll even get involved with [🦊 Vox Pupuli](https://voxpupuli.org) and help maintain our modules!

### 🏘️ Sponsorship

Overlook InfraTech is currently sponsoring and stewarding the community driven OpenVox project.

See our [installation guide](https://overlookinfratech.com/downloads/) for information on how to
start using it. The packages are currently straight rebuilds of the last releases from Puppet, Inc.
but will soon be rebranded to OpenVox and relocated within this space.


### 🎁 Contributing to the ecosystem

Community contributions are awesome and part of the way that we continue to evolve and solve the problems of today. We want to keep it as easy as possible to participate and make contributions. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things, of course!

* If you'd like to contribute to Vox Pupuli modules, then check out [the contributor's guide](https://voxpupuli.org/contributing/).
* For contributing to third-party modules, please see the contribution guidelines in the module's repository. If there is no guideline, then use your best judgement. Check the closed and open issues to see if you're attacking a known issue and follow [best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).
* To contribute to the OpenVox build pipelines, follow [our contributor's guide](https://github.com/OpenVoxProject/build-pipeline/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* For all other projects in this organization; thank you, but we are not inviting contributions while we're working on forming the OpenVox project.

### 🎟️ Reporting issues

We use GitHub Issues exclusively. Please report problems directly on each repository.
