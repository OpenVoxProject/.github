## Welcome to the OpenPuppet community 👋

Like the mythical bird, OpenPuppet has risen from the ashes of what used to be Open Source Puppet. We are still in the process of forming and architecting our governance, so follow this space!

OpenPuppet is fully Puppet™️ compatible, so modules from the Forge will work, examples and guidelines
from books will all work, etc. All the OSP / Puppetserver / PuppetDB / etc docs from puppet.com/docs
apply. When we inevitably end up diverging, we will document that and create our own docs space.


### 🎪 An interconnected community

You can get involved in the OpenPuppet community by connecting at events, getting or giving help in any of our many channels, sharing modules on the Forge, contributing code, docs, or any of your valuable insights--and many other ways, too! However you decide to jump in, we know you’ll learn a lot and enjoy meeting the smart, friendly people who make up the OpenPuppet community. Maybe you'll even fall in with our good friends at [🦊 Vox Pupuli](https://voxpupuli.org)!

Don't forget that all participation is governed by our [Code of conduct](https://voxpupuli.org/coc/).


### 🏘️ Sponsorship

Overlook InfraTech is currently sponsoring and stewarding the community driven OpenPuppet project.

See our [installation guide](https://overlookinfratech.com/downloads/) for information on how to
start using it. The packages are currently straght rebuilds of the last releases from Puppet, Inc.
but will soon be rebranded to OpenPuppet.


### 🎁 Contributing to the ecosystem

Community contributions are awesome and part of the way that we continue to evolve and solve the problems of today. We want to keep it as easy as possible to participate and make contributions. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things, of course!

* If you'd like to contribute to Vox Pupuli modules, then check out [their contributor's guide](https://voxpupuli.org/contributing/).
* For contributing to third-party modules, please see the contribution guidelines in the module's repository. If there is no guideline, then use your best judgement. Check the closed and open issues to see if you're attacking a known issue and follow [best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).
* To contribute to the OpenPuppet project, follow [our contributor's guide](https://github.com/overlookinfra/OpenPuppet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* For all other projects in this organization; thank you, but we are not inviting contributions while we're working on forming the OpenPuppet project.

We use GitHub Issues exclusively. Please reporting problems directly on each repository.
